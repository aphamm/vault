[Unlocking Your Intuition: How to Solve Hard Problems Easily - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f6N2UrCK6o)

> Intuition: “Given a problem, what has worked before? Will it also work here?”

# Brain processes
- Slow Brain → deliberate, conscious processing/reasoning
	- Insight → random, reflective, often unconscious thoughts that create new solutions
- Fast Brain → unconscious, feeling based pattern recognition
	- Intuition → solely based on past knowledge & problem at hand

# Intuition
- Intuition lays breadcrumbs down the correct stream of thoughts rather than towards red herrings
	- Only generates shallow ideas but require details from reasoning to form complete thoughts
	- Ensure initial intuition is valid via logical reasoning

# Implementation
- Create mental mapping between problem components to solution ideas
	- Understand why association works

# Nurture
- Intelligence comes from upbringing → optimistic viewpoint to gradually improve intuition
	- Your future’s past is your present’s future
	- Expose yourself to hard problems now to be better equipped to solving them in the future
