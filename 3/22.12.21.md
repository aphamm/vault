# Tejes
- If I don’t appreciate my time, who else will.
- Since I was 12, I felt like I was living two lives:
	- The material world vs. spiritual
		- Some people say fuck the spiritual world → and just say fuck bitches but then live void-less
- Naval
	- Ask priest and all they want is to fuck bitches and get money
	- Ask any drunkard and they wanna be abstinence
- It’s so hard to analyze things since the human psyche is so fickle
	- All due to emotions and ego
- Ocum’s Razor → easiest thing is to schedule

# Values
- in a person
	- an openness to try new things and consider opposing ideologies
	- not traditional book smarts but more so social intelligence in the sense of navigating witty conversation
	- self awareness of one's larger position in society and their needs/desires as an individual
	- overall style
- myself
	- an appreciation for learning for the sake of learning (without exterior motives)
	- creativity from seeing interdisciplinary relationships (a quote i really like - specialization is for ants)
	- an innately childish spirit (idc much about the "important" things in life but care alot about the seemingly meaningless things)
	- my smile :)
