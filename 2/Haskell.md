# The Haskell Brain
### Why it’s intimidating
- Primarily a research language with connections to abstract mathematics with a skewed right knowledge distribution of those willing to teach the skill
- Lack of production work (as opposed to C
### Learning to Learn
- Small repeated contributions will have major rewards → momentum
- If we focus on our egos too much, we’ll be afraid of appearing weak
### Deliberate Practice
- Deliberate → zero in on a specific idea and try and improve a certain skill until it becomes subconscious
	- Focus on the weakest smallest areas in a song first
### Compile Driven Learning
- Write as little code as you can to make the code continue to compile
	- Test Driven Development → write tests before writing your source code
- Cycle → define function + stub it as undefined
	- Make the smallest progress in defining the function that still compiles
