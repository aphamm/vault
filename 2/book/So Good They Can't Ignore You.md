### Passion is a side effect of mastery
- Self-Determination Theory (SDT) → one of the best modern scientific understanding for investigating human motives
- Theory says motivation requires three psychological needs:

### Passion is dangerous
- Psychologist Jeffrey Arnett

	- Restrict the time spent on required tasks that don’t better yourself

### What makes a great craftsman

	- Seek open gates → opportunities to build capital that are already open to you

### The adjacent possible space
- “Where Good Ideas Come From” by Johnson
	- Researchers from Columbia University found 150 different examples of prominent scientific breakthroughs made by multiple researchers at near the same time

> [!Important]
> The new chemicals are in the space of the adjacent possible defined by the current structures. The spontaneous formation of complex chemical structures from simpler structures

- We inherit ideas, stumble upon others and jigger them together into new shapes
- The next big ideas in any field are just beyond the current cutting edge, in the adjacent space (new combinations of existing ideas)
	- Important discoveries are only possible once in the adjacent possible

### Patience is key to finding mission
- Good career missions are like scientific breakthroughs, waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field
	- To find mission, you must first get to the cutting edge
	- If life-transforming missions could be found with just a little navel-gazing and an optimistic attitude, changing the world would be commonplace
		- Akin to cashing in career capital to get a desirable trait

### Practices to incorporate
- Time structure → for the next hour this is my whole world
	- I don’t care if I faint from exertion or make no progress
	- In 10 minutes, resistance died down but a strict time limit made the difficulty more manageable
- Information structure → capturing results of hard focus in useful form
	- Built a proof map of dependencies between different pieces
	- Moved to short self quizzes to memorize key definitions
	- Finally went to proof summaries → take each lemma and walk through step by step in a detailed summary in my own words
- Research bible → summarize a relevant paper
- Hour-Tally Routine → a monthly tally of all the hours of deliberate practice
- Constantly scan the adjacent possible for the next big idea
	- Top Level → tentative research mission
	- Bottom Level → background research
		- Exposure to new ideas in the field
		- One walk each day for free-form thinking about ideas from this reading
	- Middle Level → exploratory projects
		- Criteria → completable in a month, create value (master a new skill) and gives concrete results
