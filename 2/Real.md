only factors that determine the output in functional programming are the inputs passed in

higher-order function → takes in a function as a parameter

Functions with no name are known as lambda functions

map(function, iterables) → provides output after applying the function to each iterable in the sequence

filter → generate an output list of values that return true when the function is called

reduce → applies a provided function to ‘iterables’ and returns a single value
