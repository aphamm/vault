# Hits
### Legs

	- “Hit the floor with your knees”

### Torso
- Diagram → chest up a bit + push out
- Outer Pecs → practice with hands together then separate hands pressing against imaginary box
	- Focus on relax hands
- 90% Relax + 10% Tense → having relaxation in body so when you are tense it is sudden
- Variation → lean torso in different directions
### Arm
- Keep hands really relaxed
	- Wiggle fingers in between hits
- Biceps → only flex hard enough so it is not sustained
	- Triceps do get engaged
	- Forearms hit → motorcycle rev
- Wrist absorb it → think throwing a tomahawk
- Variation → straight arm
- Think of arms of an ornament on top
