## Preface
- Covers → the concepts, context, code
- Applying DL requires knowing
	- Casting a problem a particular way
	- Mathematical form of a given model
	- Optimization algorithms
	- Statistical principles for generalizability
	- Engineering techniques to train models efficiently
- Teach concepts just in time
	- Have fun making models before worrying about esoteric concepts
- Show DL from scratch (NumPy functionality) + high-level API DL frameworks
- Intuitions best formed via trial + error → must often tread where no solid theory provides guidance

## Introduction
- Machine Learning → study of algorithms that learn from experience
-
