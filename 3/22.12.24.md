What I find interesting is that I love to open text messages from friends but itâ€™s not the same enjoyment as opening a book and reading the same string of words
- This should be a comparable activity. I am reading the filtered and polished words of a respected author with a guided point in mind
- I do this willingly and with much excitement for friends who though I respect have a lot of unguided direction in the thoughts they share with me
