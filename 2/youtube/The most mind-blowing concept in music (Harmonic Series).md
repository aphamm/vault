[The most mind-blowing concept in music (Harmonic Series) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx_kugSemfY)

> *“Every note is a whole bunch of tiny notes put together”*

# Harmonics
- Harmonic = fundamental + overtones
	- Individual harmonics are just sine waves
- Overtones → integer multiple of fundamental
	- Two instruments playing same exact note sound different due to different mixture in harmonics
- Any consistent pitch can be recreated with sine waves
	- First overtones create a Major chord

# Imperfections
- Inharmonic → don’t vibrate at a consistent pitch
- Physical imperfections may contaminate harmonic series

# Music theory
- Harmonic series → foundation for all chords and scales we use
	- Certain intervals sound nice when they form “nice math”
		- ie. Octave 2:1, Perfect 5th 3:2, Perfect 4th 4:3
	- Consonant notes have many overlapping overtones
- Equal Temperament → each semitone form a ratio of $2^\frac{1}{12}$
	- Just Intonation → tuned to perfect ratio of harmonic series
